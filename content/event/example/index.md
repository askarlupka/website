abstract: Influenza virus is a globally endemic respiratory pathogen that transmits through aerosols and surfaces and contributes to 500,000 global deaths annually. Currently, developed influenza vaccines elicit strain-specific antibodies, and the vaccine strains are updated when the vaccine antibodies have an appreciable drop in hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI). Antigenic distance based on cross-reactive inhibition of HA-specific antibodies is calculated with ferret sera with no immunological history of influenza. However, the human population has an immunological history with pre-existing antibodies and memory cells that influence the response to vaccination by immune imprinting. Therefore, we investigated antigenic distances between strains using antigenic cartography calculated with human sera to determine if pre-existing immunity affected the antigenic positions of strains. The antigenic maps were stratified by the probability of the imprinting influenza strain for an individual based on their year of birth. The antigenic maps were also compared before and after vaccination with Fluzone split-inactivated virus vaccines between individuals. The antigenic landscapes were created using the log-transformed HAI titers with the two-dimensional antigenic map coordinates in the third dimension. Further, multi-dimensional scaling plots created with amino acid sequence-based antigenic distances were aligned with HAI-based antigenic distances to identify agreements in the positioning of antigens with experimental data. Overall, this work aims to improve upon predicting antigenic distances using sequence-based measures, identifying antigenically drifted and shifted influenza strains using methods that capture human’s pre-existing immunity to influenza and determining the impacts of vaccination of the antigenic breadth of an individual’s antibody repertoire.
